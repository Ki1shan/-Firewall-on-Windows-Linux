Setting Up & Using UFW (Firewall) on Linux:
     Firewalls are used to control incoming and outgoing network traffic. UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly command-line interface for managing iptables firewall rules in Linux.
     
What We Did:
Installed and Enabled UFW
    command : sudo apt install ufw -y
    command : sudo ufw enable
    This turns on the firewall to start filtering traffic.

Checked Current Rules:
    command : sudo ufw status numbered
    To see what firewall rules are active.

Blocked Telnet Port (23):
    command : sudo ufw deny 23
    This blocks all incoming traffic on port 23, which is commonly used by the insecure Telnet protocol.

Tested the Block:
    command : telnet localhost 23
    We tried to connect to port 23 and got Connection refused, meaning the firewall is working correctly.

Allowed SSH Port (22):
    command : sudo ufw allow 22
    This allows SSH connections so remote management is still possible and not blocked.

Removed the Test Rule:
    command : sudo ufw delete deny 23
    To clean up and return the firewall to its original state.

Why This Is Important:
    Port 23 (Telnet) is unsecure and should usually be blocked.
    Port 22 (SSH) is essential for secure remote access.
    This exercise shows how specific ports can be allowed or denied, helping protect a system from unwanted access.

How UFW Filters Traffic:
    UFW filters traffic based on rules set by the user.
    Rules can allow or deny incoming or outgoing connections based on port numbers.
    It works on top of iptables but provides a much easier interface.
